# iTunes-Data-Analysis

## Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a data warehouse, including ETL, star schema identification, business process analysis, dimensional modeling, data loading using Snowflake, data transformation using DBT, and data visualization using Power BI.

## Components

### 1. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)

- **Data Extraction**: Data is extracted from various sources such as databases, files, and APIs.
- **Data Transformation**: Extracted data is transformed into a format suitable for analysis using SQL and DBT.
- **Data Loading**: Transformed data is loaded into a data warehouse for storage and analysis.

### 2. Star Schema Identification

- **Identifying Fact and Dimension Tables**: Identified the primary business process and related entities to create the star schema.
- **Defining Relationships**: Defined relationships between the fact table and dimension tables to enable analysis.

### 3. Business Process Analysis

- **Understanding Business Requirements**: Analyzed the business requirements to determine the key metrics and dimensions for analysis.
- **Mapping Business Processes**: Mapped the business processes to the star schema to understand the flow of data.

### 4. Dimensional Modeling

- **Creating Fact and Dimension Tables**: Created fact tables to store metrics and dimension tables to store descriptive attributes.
- **Defining Hierarchies**: Defined hierarchies within dimension tables to enable drill-down analysis.

### 5. Snowflake for Data Loading

- **Staging Data**: Used Snowflake to stage raw data before loading it into the data warehouse.
- **Loading Data**: Loaded staged data into the fact and dimension tables using Snowflake's data loading capabilities.

### 6. DBT for Data Transformation

- **Transforming Data**: Used DBT to transform raw data into a format suitable for analysis.
- **Cleaning Data**: Cleaned and prepared data for analysis using DBT's transformation capabilities.

### 7. Power BI for Data Visualization

- **Creating Visualizations**: Used Power BI to create interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Drawing Insights**: Analyzed the visualized data to draw insights and make data-driven decisions.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building an end-to-end data warehouse, including ETL, star schema identification, business process analysis, dimensional modeling, data loading using Snowflake, data transformation using DBT, and data visualization using Power BI. It highlights the importance of each component in the data warehousing process and showcases the capabilities of modern data analytics tools.
